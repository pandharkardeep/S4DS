## Data Overview
The dataset at hand, bestowed upon us by our college, offers a glimpse into Amazon's vast marketplace. Comprising a collection of [10007 rows] and [14 columns], it encapsulates valuable information that piqued my curiosity.

## EDA Summary
During this preliminary analysis, I followed a structured approach to extract meaningful insights from the dataset:
-  Data Loading : I began by loading the Amazon_Products.csv file inside project.
-  Data Cleaning: I started by tidying up the dataset, addressing any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies that might have hindered our exploration.
-  Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistical measures were computed to shed light on central tendencies and dispersions within relevant columns.
-  Data Visualization: Employing visual aids such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, I visually portrayed the distribution of data and potential   
relationships between variables.

## Conclusion
- Its quite difficult to conclude anything in terms of ratings, as most ratings are 4 to 5 stars. This indicates a general positive sentiment among customers and suggests a substantial portion of Amazon's offerings garners favorable reviews, reflecting the platform's commitment to customer satisfaction.
- The dataset's diverse range of products, spanning from items as light as 0.1 pounds to as heavy as 2500 pounds, underscores Amazon's extensive product catalog. This diversity showcases Amazon's ability to cater to a wide array of consumer needs, from lightweight items like books to heavy appliances.
- A notable trend is the prevalence of products targeting children. The prominence of items such as toys, party hats, and art and craft supplies suggests that Amazon's platform is actively engaged in catering to the needs of young consumers and their families. This focus on children's products aligns with the modern trend of providing a wide selection of offerings for different age groups.
